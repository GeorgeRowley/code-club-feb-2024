		<h2>What is routing?</h2>

		<p>Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and so on).</p>
		<p>For example - in basic terms an example of a GET request could be, whenever you enter the URL of the website in the browser, a HTTP request is sent to the backend server, which then responds to the request and renders the web page or the website you requested.</p>

      	<h2>When to use routes</h2>

		<p>
			Where prototyping is concerned, <strong>as a general rule</strong> - we are only really concerned with the <strong>POST</strong> method.
		</p>

		<p>So, in short - if you need to link to an external website, or link to the next page without any data being entered by the user you don't need to add anything into the routes file, you can just use a standard anchor tag.</p>

		<p>
			However, in the event you are asking the user to make a decision or dependent on the selection or input it directs the user on different paths - for example asking the user a 'yes or no' question, you would create a route using an 'if statement' with the POST method on the form tag. (We will show you how to do this later).
		</p>

		<p>The other part of this session is showing you how to display data - maybe you want to ask the user their name and display it later on? In this scenario you wouldn't need to add an entry into the routes file, however you would still wrap the input in a form tag with the POST method. (Again, more on this later)</p>
